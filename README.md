# dd-benchmark

This script is a simple disk benchmarking tool using the `dd` command to measure read and write speeds. It requires input for block size, the number of blocks, and the number of runs to be performed. The average speed (MB/s) of each run will be presented at the end of each test. 

This was designed to be run on Linux systems with little to no dependencies.
